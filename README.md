# 🔍 Lookup & Rename Files by SO Report

If you need to scan and achieve lots of files everyday like me, this script is going to be helpful.

It reads an Excel report, extracts useful columns, and renames files in a folder accordingly — based on **last modified time**. (Scan your file orderly!)

### Example

```
Renamed: 1_574.pdf → O2507-100_DS-20250802_BostonScientific.pdf
